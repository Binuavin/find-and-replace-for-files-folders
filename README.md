# Find and Replace for Files and Folders

`Find and Replace for Files and Folders` project is a VBScript tool (HTA) crated for bulk renaming of files or folders within a specified directory and its subdirectories in Windows Systems. This script enables users to replace occurrences of a specific word or phrase in file names and folder names with another word or phrase. It supports bulk changing of file extensions.

**Note:**
